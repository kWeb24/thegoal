# TheGoal

**The winner of [Hangover Game Jam 2016](https://itch.io/jam/hangover-game-jam-2016)**

**[Play on Itch.io](https://kweb24.itch.io/thegoal)** or **[Download for Windows](https://github.com/kWeb24/thegoal/blob/master/TheGoal/TheGoal/Build/TheGoal_1_win.zip)**

The code is really shitty, game could hang up for a while after intro screen and has a lot of typos. But hey, it was Game Jam and I was terribly tired after new year cellebration!
